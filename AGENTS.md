# music-tools

This repository is a growing set of utilities for audio file processing.

## Purpose

Build practical scripts for common audio workflows such as:
- concatenation and merging
- compression and size reduction
- format conversion
- metadata-safe batch operations

## Working style

- Prefer small, focused command-line tools.
- Keep scripts composable and safe for large music libraries.
- Document usage in `README.md` when adding new utilities.
